# Nand-To-Tetris
This repository contains my comprehensive project journey from constructing basic logic gates to a fully functional computer system, implementing a complete software hierarchy including an assembler, VM, high-level language compiler, and operating system.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific part of the project. Below is a brief overview of each folder's contents:

### Boolean Logic and Arithmetic
Contains Hardware Description Language (HDL) files for basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and arithmetic operations (Adders), foundational to computing logic.

### Sequential Logic
This section includes implementations of sequential logic elements such as flip-flops, registers, and memory units, crucial for state retention in computing systems.

### Hack Computer Architecture
Features the construction of the Hack computer architecture, including the CPU, ALU, and memory integration, demonstrating the assembly of a working computer.

### Assembly
Includes assembly code examples and exercises, showcasing the programming of the Hack computer in its native machine language.

### VM Translator
Contains the Virtual Machine (VM) translator code and test files, translating VM commands into Hack assembly code, a key step in the software stack.

### High-Level Language
Holds files related to the Jack high-level programming language, including its compiler, allowing for more complex software development on the Hack platform.

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of computer science fundamentals. Each folder not only represents a step in the journey of building a computer but also reflects the broad spectrum of knowledge and skills I have developed through this engaging educational experience.
